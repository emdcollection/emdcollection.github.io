    <h2>Social Justice in Parade</h2>
    <p>Parade College provides many services that encourage social justice. Some of these are extra-curricular activites that benefit the community. These include becoming a member of community action, where you serve in the cafe for others, and smaller examples such as working for the Garden. In a similar vein, some services offer entertainment to anyone willing to participate. Most of these are activites a lunch time in the library, where you can have fun with others and play games. A much more substancial example is the Brekky Van that Parade College runs. This service involves giving out food to the public. Overall, Parade College has not only a lot of social justice activities, but a wide variety of activities too. This proves to be a great example of social justice.</p>

    <h2>Justice and Injustice</h2>
    <p>Although, in a perfect society, there would be no injustices, there still are many present today. Some examples include: <br><br>1. Homelessness. Although there are many services provided to homeless people, there are still many injustices revolving around them. Although someone could aid them with money, they usually choose not to. This is usually due to their own personal beliefs, but regardless of beliefs, the fact that people still need to suffer being homeless is a great injustice yet to be properly solved. <br><br>2. Discrimination. Whether it be racism, sexism, homophobia, or even lesser examples such as ageism, or more specific examples like nepotism against one, discrimination is still common in our society. In todays media, most people condem this behaviour, even if some of this behaviour occurs online. <br><br>3. Crimes. Although crime is a very extreme example, technically it is an injustice to society. It ruins the hard work of a specific person or community, depending on the crime. <br><br>Despite this, there are of course many examples of justice being carried out in our society. These examples include: <br><br>1. Free Public Services. This refers to a service usually costing money being performed for free. This includes (but is not limited to) homeless shelters, free food services, and, as a more specific examples, a man named Anthony providing free haircuts for homeless people in a park. Anthony is seen as one of the greatest social justice warriors due to his great acts of societal justice. <br><br>2. Foundations. This is companies who perform acts in a similar way to Free Services. A major difference between the two is the scale. Free services can only affect the people near it, while foundation have much larger range. They also have a much larger budget, allowing them to perform much more significant actions. The previously mentioned Thin Green Line is a good example of this contrast, as they provide assisant to anyone across the world, a feat Free services simply can not emulate. <br><br>3. Free Healthcare. A much more specific example, but one I feel should be stated. Services like Free Healthcare are extremely beenficial to societies that have it. They allow less fortunate people to recieve medical assistance without cost. Frankly, I believe it is an injustice to pay money just because of someone's crime that happened to medically affect you.</p>
