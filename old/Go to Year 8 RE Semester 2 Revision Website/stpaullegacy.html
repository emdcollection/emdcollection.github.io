<title>St Paul: Legacy</title>

<p class="titletext">St Paul Legacy</p>

<p>

    <h2>Returning from Jerusalem</h2>
    <p>Upon Paul's return to Jerusalem, he was accused of swaying people against following the Mosaic Laws, a set of laws in the Hebrew Bible, and also accused of allowing Gentiles to enter temple grounds, and defiling (damage the purity) of the temple. He was arrested and sent to a court, although Paul requested to be tried in a Roman court because everyone was against him, which would result in an unfair trial. Paul became shipwrecked and almost drowned on his way back to Rome. After 2 years of house arrest, he was permitted to continue preaching to whoever wanted to hear it.</p>    <br>
    <br>
  
  <div class="container">
    
    <h2>After the 2 Year House Arrest</h2>
    <p>After this, Paul continue his missionary work until he was arrested again after the great fire which destroyed Rome. Despite the rumour that Nero, who was the emperor at the time, lit up the fire in an attempt to arrest the Christians, Paul was found guilty. He was executed in 67 A.D. He was beheaded outside the city wall.</p>   
    <br>
    <br>
      
  </div>

  <h2>Legacy after Death</h2>
  <p>Paul's work as a missionary, as well as is letters, has aided the Christian Church in significant ways. He transfered a lot of Gentiles to Christianity, wrote many books of the Bible, and generally preached Christianity in a great way. It is greatly intriguing how someone as sinful as Saul can become such a devout Christian, completely changing his perspective all because of an encounter with Jesus.</p>
