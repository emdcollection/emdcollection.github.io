    <h2>Birth</h2>
    <p>St Paul, originally called Saul at the time, was born in 4 BCE at Tarsus, Cilicia. Tarsus is now Mersin, Turkey. At birth, Paul was part of a strictly Hebrew family, and other cultures didn't affect him or his ideals. Paul had a mother and father, and a sister, according to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2023%3A16&version=NIV#:~:text=Acts%2023%3A16%20New%20International%20Version%2016%20But%20when,he%20went%20into%20the%20barracks%20and%20told%20Paul.">Acts 23:16. At birth, Paul was taught to speak Greek.</a></p>
    <br>

    <h2>Occupation</h2>
    <p>Paul had many occupations during his life. At a young age, Paul was a tent maker, working with his own hands according to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+4%3A12&version=NIV">1 Corinthians 4:12.</a> In his early life, Paul was a Pharisee, a group of people who strictly follow Hebrew law and enforce it on others. When Paul was converted, although not initially, he became a Christian missionary, which involved him going on many religious missions and journey to spread Christianity. Additionally, more roles are given to Paul due to his apostle "status." An apostle has to make and oversee Christian churches.</p>

    <h2>Religious Beliefs</h2>
    <p>St Paul was a Jewish Roman Citizen at birth, and stricly believed in Jewish Faith. This is supported by the fact that he became a Pharisee, which heavily involves Hebrew religion. After conversion, Paul believes in Christianity, having talked to Jesus. Paul never changes religion from Christianity after that.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Did you know? The "Jewish Messiah" is significantly different to the Christian Messiah. The Jewish Messiah would be a King in the Davidic line. This King would bring Israel back to their former glory.</p>
