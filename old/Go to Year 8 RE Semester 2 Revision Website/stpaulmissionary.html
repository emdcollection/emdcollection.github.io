    <h2>Post-Vision</h2>
    <p>After Paul had encountered Jesus, he believed Jesus was the messiah. He believed Jesus talked to him as a message to preach Christianity to others, mainly Gentiles. He wrote that God will come and restore the tribes of Israel. He also wrote that the Gentiles would worship the one true God. Of the Gentiles, Paul aimed to convert the Geeks and the Barbarians, which he refered to as non-greeks in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201:14&version=NRSVA">Romans 1:14 (only in specific versions of the bible, like NRSVA).</a></p>

    <h2>First Mission - Cyrus and Turkey</h2>
    <p>Paul, Barnabas, and John Mark sailed from Seleucia to Salamis and Paphos, where Paul blinds a sorceror named Elymas (or Bar-Jesus), who was trying to drive the proconsul (A governor of a proivnce in ancient Rome). In Perga, John Marks leaves for Jerusalem, deserting the group. In Antioch (Turkey), Paul had his longest sermon (sort of religious preaching session), but Jewish leaders drove them out of the city. The Lord tells pall to focus on the Gentiles, who eventually become believers. After being driven out of other places, Paul heals a man in Lystra, causing people to believe him and Barnabus are Greek gods. Jews from Antioch (one of the places trying to get rid of Paul) get the crowd to stone Paul out of jealousy, leaving him for dead. In Derbe, Paul continues to preach, and gets many people to become Christian. On the way back to Jerusalem, Paul and Barnabas appoint elders in the churches. Via others, Paul and Barnabaus report to the leaders of the Jerusalem.</p>
   
    <br>
    <h2>Second Mission - Syria, Turkey, Macedonia, Greece, and Jerusalem</h2>
    <p>In Syria, Paul and Barnabas visit the churches again, but disagree on who should go with them on their next journey. Paul doesn't want to take John Mark due to him abandoning them last trip, so Barnabas agrees to take John Mark to Cyprus, and Paul takes Silas. In Cilicia, Paul and Silas take a letter from Jerusalem to the churches of the reigon. Whilst visiting other churches, Paul and Silas meet Timothy, and he joins them. While in Troas, Paul has a vision of a man calling for help in Macedonia. Luke was also with Paul at this point. In Philippi, a Macedonian woman named Lydia is converted to Christianity, and she allow the group to stay at her house. While here, the group encounters a slave girl possessed by the devil, which Paul converts, causing her to stop making money for her owners. Because of this, Paul and Silas are thrown in jail. During their sentence, an earthquake hits the jail. As they leave, they convert one of the jailers, and Paul and Silas are eventually excused due to their Roman citizenship. In Thessalonica, Jews try to arrest Paul and Silas. Silas and Timothy stay at Berea while Paul continues on. In Athens, Paul sees an altar to an unknown god and preachers to the people of Athens, causing some of them to believe him. In Corinth, Paul meets Aquila and Priscilla. Some people fail to get Paul arrested. This is where Paul writes 1 and 2 Thessalonians. Eventually, Paul leaves Priscilla and Aquila. Paul visits a few more churches before leaving for home.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Third Mission - Turkey, Greece, Lebanon, and Israel</h2>
    <p>After Paul visits some of the churches, he stays at Ephesus for 2 years, where he writes 1 Corinthians. Rapid conversions of the public cause silversmiths who previously made idols to start a riot due to their loss of money as no one is buying their statues. In Greece, Paul writes 2 Corinthians and Romans. In Troas, a man sleeping through Paul's preaching falls out of a window and dies. Paul revives him. Elders from Ephesus meet the ship at Miletus. Paul tells them he expects to be imprisoned in Jerusalem. Later on, the disciples warn Paul not to go to Jerusalem. In Caesarea, a prophet predicts Paul will be imprisoned and handed over to the Gentiles. Back at Jerusalem, the missionaries report to the leaders of the church, who want Paul to join a ritual at the temple to disprove rumours of Christianity being anti-Jewish.</p>
